# AnalyticalQuantumSpeedLimit
This Jupyter notebook employs the sympy Python module to calculate the quantum speed limit, also known as the Mandelstam-Tamm bound and the Margolus-Levitin bound. The calculations presented are based on straightforward examples and re-calculations derived from well-established research papers.
